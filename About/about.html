  <h1>The Schoolarly Bay</h1>
  <h3>A collection of works by adolescent scholars</h3>
  <div class="div">
     <h4>About</h4>
     <p class="text">Schoolarly Bay is a online database made to put adolescent research papers online to help share the knowledge to the world.</p>
     <h4>Why</h4>
     <p class="text">I, Editor Rust, made Schoolarly Bay to prevent all of the research papers written by students from going to waste, either by lying at the bottom of a closet for eternity or be disposed of, by recycling or other less common methods, namely buring and composting. The idea is that future students will be able to come to the Schoolarly Bay to get sources for their research papers, or for ordinary people to learn somthing new.</p>
     <h4>Inspiration</h4>
     <p class="text">One thing that inspired me to make the Schoolarly Bay was the Anne Arundle County Pubic Library which had a section called <a href="https://www.aacpl.net/journals-articles" class="link">journals and scholarly articles</a>, which I would often visit when writing a research paper. It made me think of all the papers that were written with wonderful information that got lost forever. A while later, when COVID-19 started I learned coding, and started making websites, two of them called <a href="https://hillside-township.github.io/" class="link">Hillside Township</a> and <a href="https://editorrust.github.io/gold-rush" class="link">Gold Rush</a>. Then I knew everything I needed to start this, but I did not make the connection. At the start the school year 2020-2021 we were assigned a communtiy service project, which required us to do somthing that would have a long-standing effect on our communtiy. Finaly I relized what needed to be done, so I made this website. I hope you benefit from it!</p>
     <h4>The Founder</h4>
     <p class="text">All about me, Editor Rust! I am a sophomore who enjoys programming. I started building this site on October 10th 2020 with my BFF tildejustin (search on GitHub) to help people learning online have access to research paper sources even while the library is closed. I like reading and going to the library, so I find that extreamly sad. You can see my coding projects on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/editorrust" class="link">here</a>.</p>
